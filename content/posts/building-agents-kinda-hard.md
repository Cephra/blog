Now as you probably know, I've been working on developing an agentic blog post writer.

Turns out it's way harder than anticipated. 

I first tried using LangChain, a popular framework used to develop agents and accomplish complex LLM tasks. The problem with it is that we are in such an early stage of all this new AI stuff that this framework is still in development. And sadly right now it's undergoing big refactoring changes.
With its documentation still referring to things from before the refactoring, it's far from reliable.
Don't get me wrong though. I still had some good success with LangChain to some degree. 

This actually brings us to the next pain point. The LLM I am using, although initially I was amazed by Llama 3, getting it to behave the way I want is really complicated.
