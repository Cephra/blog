## Getting Started with Our TeamSpeak Server 

Hey friends, just wanted to mention that I've got our TeamSpeak 3 server up and running for us to hang out in while we chat together.

If you want to join in on some virtual catch-ups with me and the others, feel free to hop on over. We'd love to have you drop by and say hi.

You can find it at: [0x29a.me:4711](ts3server://0x29a.me?port=4711)

Once you're in, we can chat about our lives, make plans, or just shoot the breeze. This is a casual space, so feel free to hang out and relax.

If you want to get an idea of who's already online, you can check out the status page at https://ts.0x29a.me/. It shows us in real-time.

No big announcements needed - I just thought it'd be cool to spread the word that our server is live and ready for action.
