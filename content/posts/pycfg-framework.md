## Pycfg: A Pythonic Approach to Half-Life 2 Deathmatch Scripting

As I reflect on my experiences with scripting Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, a project that predates my professional career stands out â€“ pycfg, a humble framework I created as a hobbyist to simplify the process of crafting complex scripts for HL2DM. Developed over **10 years ago**, pycfg was a testament to my early fascination with game development and the power of Python.

If you are new to Half-Life 2 Deathmatch scripting I encourage you to read my previous post: [Half-Life 2 Deathmatch Scripting](/posts/hl2dm-scripting)

### The Birth of Pycfg

In the midst of exploring the depths of Half-Life 2 Deathmatch scripting, I recognized the potential for leveraging Python's capabilities in game scripting. This led me to create pycfg, a small framework designed specifically for HL2DM that allowed users to generate scripts using Python syntax.

### Features and Impact

With pycfg, users could tap into some basic features provided by Python, integrating them with HL2DM's scripting language. One of the key features included classes for entities and vectors, enabling developers to model complex game scenarios with ease. Furthermore, pycfg made use of Python operator overloading to simplify vector mathematics, providing a more intuitive interface for performing calculations.

For example, adding two vectors together could be as simple as using the `+` operator:

```python
v1 = Vec(1, 2)
v2 = Vec(3, 4)
result = v1 + v2
```

This simplified vector math was particularly useful in HL2DM scripting, where calculations involving positions, velocities, and accelerations were common.

- **Personal Learning Experience:** Pycfg served as an educational project where I experimented with combining Python with HL2DM scripting.
- **Early Community Engagement:** Although it was only used by a handful of people, including myself, pycfg showed me the potential for community involvement and shared learning in game development.

#### Showcase: Screenshot

Below is an example screenshot demonstrating what can be achieved using pycfg for Half-Life 2 Deathmatch scripting.

You can see a ball of blastdoors and a tube of rollermines, with a color fade. I've used trig functions to achieve this.

### Legacy

Pycfg remains a nostalgic reminder of my early days as a hobbyist developer. It highlights how even small projects can demonstrate connections between one's interests and professional pursuits. The lessons learned from pycfg continue to influence my approach to software development today, emphasizing the value of experimentation, community engagement, and embracing new tools and technologies.
