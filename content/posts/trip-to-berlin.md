## First time in the capital city
Two friends and I, while hanging around in TeamSpeak, realized that all of us have never been to Berlin, Germany's capital city.

And so we thought to ourselves: Let's change that!

On the day before, I made sure I had all my stuff prepared and went to bed early as our train was to leave at around 8:00 AM. It was exciting to finally embark on this adventure and get a good night's sleep beforehand helped me feel refreshed for the journey ahead.

## Day 1 - Wednesday
### Departure
Not only was it my first ever trip to Berlin, but also my first trip on an Inter City Express (ICE). And I must say, I've really enjoyed it. As we departed from our starting point, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation and excitement for the adventure that lay ahead.

I travel by train a lot but never for longer distances such as this trip to Berlin. Did you know that the ICE is a high-speed rail network in Germany and one of the most popular ways to get around?

### Arrival
After sitting on the train for about 4 hours, we finally saw the first buildings of Berlin's cityscape. As we stepped off the train, the cool morning air hit us, and we couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment at having made it to our destination.

### The Hotel
We stayed at the Upper Room Hotel near Kurfürstendamm, not the best but not the worst either. It's a very functional hotel, so to speak. Although it wasn't luxurious, it served its purpose and provided us with a comfortable place to rest our heads for the night.

### Currywurst
After we stashed our luggage at the hotel, we decided that we had to have some food ASAP. On the way to the hotel one of my friends noticed that "Curry 36" had a place not too far away. So that's where we went. It was good. Not impressive, but good.

Did you know that Currywurst is one of Germany's most popular fast food dishes? We definitely gave it a try and enjoyed its unique flavor combination.

### Walking & Sightseeing
Now that we'd filled our tummies, it was time we started our Walking & Sightseeing journey. We set out to explore the city, taking in the sights and sounds of Berlin.

### Siegessäule

The Siegessäule stands tall in Berlin's Tiergarten park, a monument to Prussian military victories & German unification.

### Brandenburg Gate
![brandenburg](https://fs.0x29a.me/static/brandenburg.webp)
We saw the iconic Brandenburg Gate. It's a must-see attraction for anyone visiting Berlin, and I can see why it's so famous.

### Russian Embassy
Also notable was the Russian Embassy, which stood out due to its grand architecture.

### Reichtstag Building

And of course, we visited the impressive Reichstag Building!

## Day 2 - Thursday
After a good night of sleep, we did some brainstorming on what to do this day. We decided that the rough direction was East Side Gallery and we'll go from there.

### East Side Mall
Before going to the East Side Gallery, we decided to go to the East Side Mall to buy some drinks and snacks to eat during our city journey. It's a great place to grab something to eat or just relax for a bit.

### East Side Gallery

![eastside5](https://fs.0x29a.me/static/eastside5.webp)
This place was really cool, kind of scary too. The vibrant street art and graffiti-covered walls were a treat for the eyes. Did you know that the East Side Gallery is a 1.3 kilometer-long section of the Berlin Wall?

### Alexanderplatz
A must-see place for tourists, I guess. It's bustling with people, street performers, and food stalls.

### Checkpoint Charlie

Standing at the spot where East met West: Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin's iconic symbol of freedom & reunification. A must-see stop on any Berlin itinerary!

### Museum Island
Impressive buildings around here with awesome architecture. We didn't have time to visit any museums this trip, but it was great just walking around and taking in the sights.

## Day 3 - Friday
### KaDeWe
This one was cool. Felt like the home of capitalism. The sheer scale and luxury of the store were impressive.

![kadewe1](https://fs.0x29a.me/static/kadewe1.webp)

Did you know that KaDeWe is one of Europe's largest department stores and a popular shopping destination in Berlin? We didn't do much shopping, but it was fun to browse around and take in the atmosphere.

### Hard Rock Cafe
Just another one of those... :smile:. We stopped by for a quick coffee and to take a look at some memorabilia.

### Party on the Alexanderplatz
Greenpeace was having a party at the Weltuhr on Alexanderplatz. Kinda chill. It was great seeing people come together like that, even if we didn't join in ourselves.

## Day 4 - Saturday
### Regierungsviertel
We've spent a lot of time around Tiergarten Park and Regierungsviertel this day. It's an area with a mix of government buildings, parks, and monuments.

### 420 Day Berlin
![420](https://fs.0x29a.me/static/420.webp)
Coincidentally on this day, there was also a "420 Day" party near the Brandenburg Gate to celebrate April 20th, the "international cannabis day". With the recent partial legalization of cannabis in Germany, the scale of that party was huge. Walking past the crowds of people and smelling the clouds of weed smoke was a surreal experience indeed. I'm not sure what to make of it, but it was definitely memorable!

### Departure back home
Time to say goodbye, Berlin. Now I must admit that after all those days of walking up and down through the city of Berlin, I was quite relieved when sitting in the comfort of the ICE. It was nice seeing you, though!
