## Back on Wheels
### My Journey

It's been a long and arduous road, but I'm finally on the path to recovery after having those pesky screws and plates removed from my leg.

### The Injury Details

I sustained a Weber C fracture on my left ankle - not exactly the most pleasant experience. To be honest, it's still a bit surreal thinking about how multiple screws and plates were installed to help me heal.

### Removal of Hardware

The screws and plates were successfully removed in late 2023, marking a significant milestone on my journey to full recovery.

### Reflections and Lessons Learned

I've already noticed that I have to relearn some things. I've never been a professional skater anyways - I mostly just drove around. With the hardware removal behind me, my interest in skating has sparked again this Summer 2024. The injury wasn't directly related to my love of skating (a good thing, if you ask me!). I'm eager to get back out there and hit the pavement once more.
