I just finished my biggest hobby project... almost!

My project is a management app for house meter data, allowing homeowners to create graphs and analyze the usage of gas, water, electricity, and other utilities.

After days of planning and tinkering, I'm thrilled to announce that I've made significant progress on my most ambitious hobby IT project to date! It's been a wild ride, with its fair share of setbacks and triumphs, but it was all worth it in the end. :star:

It took weeks. Weeks turned into months as I encountered unexpected challenges and had to troubleshoot my way through them. But just when I thought I was close to finishing, reality hit me - I had hit a roadblock! The project was stalled, and I didn't know how to move forward.

But during that time, I used those extra years to learn new skills and gain a fresh perspective. After a two-year break from 2022 to now, 2024, I'm back at it with renewed energy and enthusiasm. I migrated from Nuxt 2 to 3 and also got the newest version of Loopback.io, which I've used for the backend. It was a daunting task at first, but the sense of accomplishment I felt when it was all done was incredible. :muscle:

Now that I'm back on track, I'm excited to share my progress with you. While I still have some work left to do, I feel more motivated than ever to finish what I started. It's not perfect, and I'm still figuring things out, but I'm proud of the progress I've made so far, and I can't wait to see where this project takes me in the end. :tada:
