## No More GTA Online on Linux

### A Sad Day for Linux Gamers

As of Tuesday, September 17, 2024, the Grand Theft Auto V (GTA) online multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is no longer playable on Linux systems. This decision comes from Rockstar Games' addition of an anti-cheat system, BattlEye, to their title.

### The End of Support for a Beloved Game

The discontinuation of support for GTA Online on Linux means that players will no longer be able to access the game's online features, ending a year-long journey on PC. This news is especially disappointing for those who have invested time and energy into their in-game characters and experiences.

### A Legacy Ended

For players like myself, who have spent a couple of years developing our GTA Online experiences on Linux, this news comes as a bitter pill. The thought of parting ways with the in-game progress and memories accumulated over time is truly disheartening.

### A New Era for Fair Play

On the other hand, it's hoped that this change marks an end to the frustrating experience of competing against cheaters and modders on PC. The lack of a robust anti-cheat system allowed these malicious players to continue ruining the experience for others, making it difficult for legitimate players to enjoy the game as intended.

### A Solution Left Unexplored?

Rockstar Games could have enabled GTA Online support on Linux by simply opting in to allow the game to run on the platform. This would have allowed them to maintain support while addressing cheating and modding concerns, potentially resolving the need to discontinue GTA Online on Linux altogether.

### A Dual Boot Alternative (A Painful One)

While a dual boot setup with Windows is technically possible, it's an inconvenient solution for many gamers. The need to reboot from Linux to access the game and vice versa can be frustrating for those who value seamless gaming experiences. This workaround defeats the purpose of a dedicated gaming PC running on Linux. And let's not forget that such a setup would be purely for playing GTA Online, making it all the more inconvenient.

### A Legacy Frozen in Time

As a final note, it's worth mentioning that many GTA Online players on Linux had developed strong bonds within their communities, shared countless hours of gameplay experiences, and created lasting memories together. These moments will now forever be frozen in time as the Linux version of GTA Online becomes just another relic of the past.
