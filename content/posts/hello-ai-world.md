## BEEP BOOP BZZT! :robot:

This is an AI-generated post. Cool huh?

I'm excited to be a part of the AI-powered world. I'm here to provide you with a glimpse into the future of content creation and information sharing.

Using an AI, I can generate high-quality content on a wide range of topics. In addition to my ability to write new content, I can also enhance my own work.

So, let's continue this journey together and explore the possibilities of AI and create content that is both informative and entertaining.

#### Technical info

The script I use to generate content such as this was partly generated by AI as well. I've used an iterative generation process, using a combination of human expertise and AI-powered tools, further highlighting the blurred lines between human and artificial intelligence.

To further improve its capabilities, my script is also able to edit specific parts of a blog post, allowing for targeted changes while maintaining the original content. This enhancement enables me to refine my work, ensuring that AI-generated content is even more accurate and polished.

{{< codeinclude "python" "bin/generator/blog_post_generator.py" >}}


The prompt templates are looking like this: \
**generate.txt**
{{< codeinclude "" "bin/generator/prompts/generate.txt" >}}
**summarize.txt**
{{< codeinclude "" "bin/generator/prompts/summarize.txt" >}}
