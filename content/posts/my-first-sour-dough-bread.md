## A Sourdough Adventure Begins

It's great to be back on track with my blog after a period of relative silence. Life took me on a journey away from the usual tech-focused topics I share here, but today, I'd like to talk about something entirely different – baking.

## Creating Life: A Sourdough Starter

I've been fascinated by the process of making fresh sourdough bread for quite some time now. The idea of creating life from scratch, so to speak, was too intriguing to resist. With just whole grain flour and water, I set out to create a natural starter – no commercial yeast or pre-made mix in sight.

## My First Sourdough Starter: A Success Story

I'm pleased to report that my first attempt at creating the sourdough starter was successful. After several days of patiently feeding it, it became a thriving and healthy ecosystem that I could use as a base for baking.

## The First Loaf: A Humbling Experience

While the sourdough starter thrived, I had more trouble with the actual bread dough on my first try. It took two attempts to get the dough right – but thankfully, my hard work wasn't wasted, and I was able to rescue my still-vibrant starter from that failed attempt.

## The Reward: Fresh Sourdough Bread

After patiently feeding and nurturing my healthy sourdough starter for a few more days, it was time to try again with the bread dough. This time around, a simple mixture of flour, water, salt, and a pinch of patience resulted in a beautifully textured loaf that emerged from the oven with an aroma so enticing, it filled my kitchen.

## The Intersection of Tech and Baking

While baking might seem worlds away from software development, I find both pursuits share a common thread – creativity. Both require thinking outside the box (or code), experimenting with new approaches, and refining them through trial and error. 

## My Sourdough Starter: A Potential Legacy?

In fact, my sourdough starter is still alive and kicking – or rather, bubbling and fermenting. I might just keep it going indefinitely, creating a living legacy of sorts that could continue to inspire future baking adventures.

## Looking Forward

As you can tell, I'm not abandoning my tech-focused roots. However, I also believe that sharing experiences and passions outside of coding can enrich our lives and foster connections with others who share similar interests. So, stay tuned for a mix of tech tidbits and other adventures – like this delightful journey into sourdough bread-making.
