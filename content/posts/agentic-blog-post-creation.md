As a developer, I'm excited to share my journey of building an agentic tool for blog post creation and refinement, which was first introduced in [Building an Agent](/posts/building-an-agent). This innovative project allows me to engage in seamless conversations with a bot in a terminal, and it will be editing this very post for me as we speak.

## The Concept of Agency

The idea behind agency is to create an artificial intelligence system that can act on its own behalf, making decisions and taking actions based on its programming. In the context of writing, this means that the AI agent can generate content independently, without requiring constant human oversight or intervention.

### Creating the Framework

To build the framework, I implemented a simple loop that uses the `input()` function to receive user input, allowing me to interact with the AI agent through a text-based interface. I also used Ollama, a local AI framework that provides as the runtime for the LLM I'm using.

#### Collaborative Blog Post Generation

In this post, you're reading the output of the very tool I've built. As I write, the AI agent is editing and refining my words in real-time, using its understanding of language and tone to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. But of course I can still make manual changes to the text as needed.

### Conclusion

Building an agentic AI framework has been a fascinating journey that combines creative problem-solving with the power of machine learning. The resulting system allows me to collaborate with a bot in a terminal, generating high-quality content that meets my writing needs. In this post, you've seen firsthand the power of agentic AI in action â€“ and I'm not done yet! Future updates will include new features such as enhanced web search capabilities, advanced formatting options, and more precise editing tools to further streamline the collaborative writing experience.

Stay tuned for updates on its development! :rocket:
