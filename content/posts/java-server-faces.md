### JSF: A Nightmare to Use in Modern Times

#### The Rise and Fall of JSF: A Cautionary Tale

What's the point of Java Server Faces (JSF) in today's world? It's an absolute nightmare to use, and abstracting away the fundamental web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a crime.

In its time, JSF was supposed to simplify the development process for Java-based web applications. However, it ended up being a cumbersome framework that hindered creativity and innovation. The complexity of JSF led to a steep learning curve, making it difficult for developers to adopt.

One of the main issues with JSF is its lack of understanding of modern web development. It was designed before the rise of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript-based front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. As a result, JSF struggled to keep up with the latest trends and best practices in web development.

Another problem with JSF is its verbosity. The framework requires a significant amount of boilerplate code, which can be overwhelming for developers who are more comfortable with lightweight and agile coding approaches. This verbosity also makes it difficult to maintain and debug large-scale applications built using JSF.

#### The Dark Side of JSF: Maintenance Nightmares

But the problems don't stop there. Once you've invested time and resources into building a JSF-based application, maintaining it becomes a nightmare. The complexity of the framework, combined with its verbosity, makes it difficult to identify and fix issues when they arise. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, only the haystack is made up of millions of lines of code.

#### A New Era: Ditching JSF for Better Alternatives

In terms of alternatives, there are many other frameworks and libraries that can help you build robust and scalable web applications without the hassle of JSF. Some popular options include:

* **Spring MVC**: A Java-based framework for building RESTful web services.
* **Vaadin**: A Java-based framework for building web applications with a focus on rich-client-side functionality.
* **Play Framework**: A Java-based framework for building scalable and lightweight web applications.

If you're looking to start a new project or migrate an existing one from JSF, it's worth exploring these alternatives. They can help you build more maintainable and scalable applications that are better suited to modern web development requirements.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, JSF is no longer the best choice for building modern web applications. Its lack of understanding of modern web development, verbosity, and maintenance nightmares make it a nightmare to use. It's time to say goodbye to JSF and hello to better alternatives that can help you build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.
