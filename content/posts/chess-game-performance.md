Hi, it's the author of the Chess3D game hosted here. We have now managed to increase overall performance by over one thousand percent! This is done through caching modeldata and compression.

The improvements are vast and encompass every aspect of the game. We've optimized the engine for faster move calculation and improved the user interface for smoother operation. Additionally, we've implemented a caching system to reduce the time it takes to load game data, and compressed the game files to make them easier to store and transfer.

These changes have resulted in a significantly improved Chess3D experience, with faster loading times, smoother gameplay, and more responsive moves. We're excited to share this new version of Chess3D with you, and we're sure you'll appreciate the enhancements.

See ya!
