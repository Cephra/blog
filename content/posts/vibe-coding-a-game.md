## My Vibe Coding Adventure: Creating a 2D Top Scrolling Space Game
### Introduction

I recently had the opportunity to try out vibe coding, a unique approach to programming where various tools and editors generate code based on your requests, including ChatGPT with its Canvas feature as one example. Using these platforms, you review and adjust the generated code before trying again. I decided to put this process to the test by creating a 2D top scrolling space game using Vibe Coding.

### The Project: Galactic Skirmish

The game I created is called Galactic Skirmish, where a green triangular ship must fight against hordes of red triangular ships while navigating through a scrolling starfield background. The objective was simple: survive as long as possible and earn points for each enemy defeated.

### Vibe Coding the Game

Using ChatGPT with its Canvas feature, I provided the initial prompt to create the game's core mechanics. The code generated was rough around the edges but gave me a solid foundation to build upon. Over several iterations, I refined the game's logic, adding features such as scoring, collision detection, and smoother scrolling. Phaser was used as the underlying game engine to bring the game to life.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

One of the key takeaways from my experience with vibe coding is that it's essential to break down requests into smaller, manageable chunks. Asking for small but concise changes between iterations proved to be more effective than attempting to overhaul the entire codebase at once. This allowed me to make steady progress without getting bogged down in complex modifications.

### Conclusion

My experience with vibe coding has been a game-changer (pun intended). It's an efficient and creative way to develop games, allowing me to focus on the design aspects rather than spending hours writing boilerplate code. If you're interested in trying out vibe coding for yourself, I highly recommend it - just be prepared to think creatively and adapt quickly!
