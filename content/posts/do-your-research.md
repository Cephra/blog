### Issues Aren't Always Accurate

#### Bad Researching Problems

Many people who use code-sharing sites like GitHub report problems without checking them first. They just post an issue without trying to figure out what's going on.

#### Wasting Time

This means many reported issues are not real, taking up space and time that could be used for better things. It also means the developers have to spend their time looking into something that might not even be a problem.
