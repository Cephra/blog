## The Never-Ending Nightmare of Java Annotations in Spring Boot

Are you kidding me?! Is this what I signed up for when I chose to work with Spring Boot? A never-ending hellhole of Java annotations that make my head spin and my eyes water?!

I mean, come on! What's the point of having a framework that promises ease of use and rapid development if it's just going to dump a load of bureaucratic nonsense on me?! Don't get me wrong, I love Spring Boot for its many advantages, but this annotation madness is just too much!

It starts innocently enough. You create a simple `@RestController` and think you're all set. But then you realize you need to add some dependencies, maybe a few more classes, and before you know it, your code is a tangled mess of annotations! `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`... and that's just the tip of the iceberg!

And don't even get me started on the configuration files! `application.properties`, `application.yml`, `XxxxConfig.java`... it's like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while being attacked by a swarm of bees!

But wait, there's more! You've got the `@Profile` annotation, which makes your code depend on the environment you're running in. Try to figure out why your code isn't working when you switch from dev to prod... I dare you!

And what about all those mysterious `@Bean` annotations?! Are they trying to confuse me on purpose?! "Oh, just add this bean here and it'll fix everything!" NO, IT WON'T FIX ANYTHING! IT'LL JUST MAKE THINGS WORSE!

I swear, if I have to deal with one more Java annotation-related headache, I'm going to lose my mind! Is there no escape from this annotation hell?! Can someone please just give me a simple, straightforward way to write code without having to wade through a sea of annotations?!

Ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to rip my hair out! Spring Boot, why dost thou torment me so?
