I just finished my biggest hobby project... almost!

After days of planning and tinkering, I'm thrilled to announce that I've made significant progress on my most ambitious DIY project to date! It's been a wild ride, with its fair share of setbacks and triumphs, but it was all worth it in the end. :star:

It took weeks. Weeks turned into months as I encountered unexpected challenges and had to troubleshoot my way through them. And then, just when I thought I was getting close to the finish line, I decided to take a two-year break from the project from 2022 to now, 2024.

But during that time, I used those extra years to learn new skills and gain a fresh perspective. After the break, I migrated from Nuxt 2 to 3 and also got the newest version of Loopback.io, which I've used for the backend. It was a daunting task at first, but the sense of accomplishment I felt when it was all done was incredible. :muscle:

Now that I'm back on track, I'm excited to share my progress with you. I'm actually really close to completing the project now, and I can hardly wait to show you the final result (which is just around the corner!). While it's not quite finished yet, I'm hoping to wrap things up soon and take a moment to appreciate what I've accomplished so far. It's not perfect, but it's mine and I'm proud of what I've done. :tada:
