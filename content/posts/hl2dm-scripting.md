## Where the Magic Happened (2008)

Back in 2008, before Garry's Mod truly took off, there was a different kind of sandbox waiting to be explored: Half-Life 2 Deathmatch on sv_cheats 1 servers. These servers were havens for creativity and chaos.

Players would gather, teaching randoms who stumbled in how the scripting was done, or showing off their own creations. Imagine custom vehicles rumbling through the environment, crazy huge guns firing off improbable projectiles, players surrounded by dazzling aura effects, or entire buildings constructed from scratch, defying the game's original design.
This was my playground. I spent countless hours diving into these chaotic worlds, learning from the scripts, and even trying my hand at creating my own. It was awesome!

When I turned 16, I remember being completely absorbed by the code of the Source SDK. I dove deep, just trying to understand how everything worked.

My passion for software development, already strong, only intensified. Deciphering some of the inner workings of the Source engine, understanding how scripts could manipulate the game world, it all felt like magic.  It planted the seeds for my future journey as a developer, showing me the incredible power of code to shape interactive experiences.

Those sv_cheats 1 servers hold a special place in my memory. They weren't just about the games; they were a community, a place to learn, experiment, and be inspired. It's a reminder that sometimes the most unexpected places can spark incredible journeys.
