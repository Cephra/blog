I wrote a system using webhooks to automate the deployment of all my web applications as soon as changes are merged into the main branch. This has been incredibly convenient and has streamlined my workflow significantly. :star:

The biggest advantage of automating deployment is that it saves time and effort. No longer do you have to manually trigger each deployment, which can be a tedious process. With automation, you only need to make changes to your code and let the system take care of the rest. This means you can focus on writing new features or fixing bugs instead of worrying about the deployment process. :muscle:

Another benefit is reduced errors. When humans are involved in the deployment process, there's always a risk of human error. A misplaced file or incorrect configuration can cause issues with your application. By automating deployment, you eliminate this risk and ensure that each deployment is consistent and reliable. :raised_hands:

Automation also helps to increase efficiency and consistency. Deployment processes can be complex and involve multiple steps. Automating these processes ensures that each step is taken in the correct order and that no crucial steps are missed. This results in a more efficient and consistent deployment process, which can lead to improved overall performance and reduced downtime. :sunny:

Finally, automation gives you peace of mind. Knowing that your deployments are being handled automatically means you can focus on other tasks without worrying about whether your application is being deployed correctly. You can rest assured that your application will be updated with the latest changes, no matter where you are in the world. :earth_africa:

As an example of this in action, I'd like to share a link to [https://www.0x29a.me/](https://www.0x29a.me/), which is one such application that has been automated using webhooks.

In my particular case, I have made it so that each project has a `deploy.sh` file inside its root which contains the necessary steps on a per-project basis. This allows me to customize the deployment process for each individual project, ensuring that they are deployed correctly and efficiently. :bulb:
