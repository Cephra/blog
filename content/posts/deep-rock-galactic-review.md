## Deep Rock Galactic: A Great Game with Room for Improvement

Deep Rock Galactic. It's a great game with a ton of fun to be had. However, there's one area that could be improved: the AI can be so unbelievably stupid at times.

Just the other day, I was attempting to complete a mission and encountered a scenario that perfectly illustrates this point. The objective was to extract a precious resource from deep within the caverns. However, the AI decided to take a detour, opting to climb straight up a tubular shaft instead of finding a more feasible route. This, naturally, made it impossible for my friends and me to reach the extraction pod.

It's incredibly frustrating to put so much effort into completing a mission only to be thwarted by the AI's sheer incompetence. Not only does it waste time and resources, but it also completely ruins the immersion and sense of accomplishment that comes with completing a challenging objective.

While I understand that AI can be imperfect, it's really pushing it to call this behavior acceptable. I've encountered countless situations where the AI has made incredibly dumb decisions, ranging from simple navigation errors to more complex tactical blunders. It's as if the developers were more focused on creating a flashy, albeit superficial, game world rather than one that is grounded in reality.

However, I believe that the developers are capable of addressing this issue. With a little effort, they could create an AI that is more competent and reliable. Until then, I'm afraid I'll have to accept my fate with that stupid AI. :angry:
