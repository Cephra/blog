## Back on Wheels
### My Journey

It's been a long and arduous road, but I'm finally on the path to recovery after having those pesky screws and plates removed from my leg.

### The Injury Details

* It happened on my left ankle 
* I had sustained a Weber C fracture - not exactly the most pleasant experience
* To be honest, it's still a bit surreal thinking about how multiple screws and plates were installed to help me heal

### Reflections and Lessons Learned

The injury wasn't directly related to my love of skating (a good thing, if you ask me!). I'm eager to get back out there and hit the pavement once more.
