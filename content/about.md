### Hi :wave:

my name is Christian Frantzen, born in 1994.

Growing up, I've been fascinated by the world of technology and programming.

As a teen, I was hooked on learning to code and spent many hours exploring programming languages and tools.
This curiosity has only grown stronger over time, leading me to eventually become a software developer.

This is my personal blog, where share thoughts on things that
- I'm currently working on in my spare time
- have worked on before as hobby projects
- or I'm just interested in

Things I'm interested in:
- Web Development
- AI
- GNU/Linux
- Optimization
- and more...
